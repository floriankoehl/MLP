Things to mention: 


- There were no missing values (described in description of dataset so no preprocessing was necessary)
- I need to explain crossover, mutation and model_selection
- Explain the plots and the data 
- Explain that i didnt go for fault taulerance but something else because thats what the dataset provides as target values or so
- Say that i didnt use seed even though the evaluation can be slow but for the size of this dataset i decided for that because it wouldnt matter that much and i just wanted to be as accurate as possible

- I need to evaluate the model (later compare it with normal backpropargation)
- I need to explain every plot
